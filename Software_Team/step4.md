The Wordfence Firewall protects the server from a number of common web-based attacks as well as a large amount of attacks specifically targeted at WordPress and WordPress themes and plugins. Wordfence claims that its firewall can protect against attacks such as SQL Injection, Cross Site Scripting, Malicious File Upload and more.

## Firewall setup

Press Firewall in Wordfence dashboard and you can see options to customize firewall for the server. For this demonstration, we will leave the settings at the default learning mode which will automatically learns about ther site so that it can understand how to protect and how to allow normal visitors through the firewall.

You can also see some advanced option such as Rate Limiting and Blocking at the bottom but we are not going to use it for this demonstration.
